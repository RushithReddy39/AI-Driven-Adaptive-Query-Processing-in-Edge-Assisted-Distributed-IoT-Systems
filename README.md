# AI-Driven-Adaptive-Query-Processing-in-Edge-Assisted-Distributed-IoT-Systems
AI-driven query processing framework for edge-assisted IoT systems that uses machine learning to dynamically route queries across device, edge, and cloud layers, reducing latency and improving scalability

Project Overview:

The AI-Driven Adaptive Query Processing in Edge-Assisted Distributed IoT Systems project addresses the growing challenges of managing massive, real-time data generated by IoT devices. Traditional cloud-based query processing often suffers from high latency, bandwidth constraints, and limited scalability, making it unsuitable for time-critical applications. To overcome these issues, our framework integrates edge computing with an AI-powered query routing mechanism, enabling smarter and more efficient query execution.

At its core, the system uses a lightweight machine learning model to adaptively decide whether queries should be processed at the device, edge, or cloud layer, based on real-time factors such as CPU utilization, memory availability, network bandwidth, and query complexity. Incoming queries are decomposed into sub-queries and optimally distributed across layersâ€”filtering operations at the device layer, partial aggregations at the edge, and complex computations or long-term storage at the cloud. This adaptive and resource-aware scheduling not only reduces query response time but also ensures efficient load balancing across heterogeneous IoT devices.

Experimental simulations demonstrated that the framework achieves up to 20% faster query response times and 15% lower resource consumption compared to static allocation methods, with an average response time of 2.18 seconds. Most lightweight queries were efficiently handled by the device layer, while the edge layer optimized intermediate processing, and AI-based routing ensured balanced workloads and reduced energy usage.

This project has strong applicability in real-time IoT domains, including smart cities (traffic monitoring, energy management), healthcare (remote patient monitoring), industrial IoT (predictive maintenance, automation), and agriculture (sensor-driven precision farming). By combining AI with edge-cloud architectures, the framework offers a scalable, flexible, and intelligent solution for distributed IoT query processing.
