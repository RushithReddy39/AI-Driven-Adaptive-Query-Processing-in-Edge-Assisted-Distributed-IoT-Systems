# AI-Driven-Adaptive-Query-Processing-in-Edge-Assisted-Distributed-IoT-Systems
AI-driven query processing framework for edge-assisted IoT systems that uses machine learning to dynamically route queries across device, edge, and cloud layers, reducing latency and improving scalability

Project Overview:

The AI-Driven Adaptive Query Processing in Edge-Assisted Distributed IoT Systems project addresses the challenges of handling massive, real-time data generated by IoT devices. Traditional cloud-based query processing often struggles with high latency, bandwidth limitations, and scalability issues. To overcome this, our framework integrates edge computing with an AI-powered query routing mechanism for smarter and more efficient processing.

Key Features:

Adaptive Query Routing: Uses a lightweight machine learning model to dynamically decide whether queries should be executed at the device, edge, or cloud layer.
Resource-Aware Scheduling: Takes into account CPU utilization, memory availability, network bandwidth, and query complexity in real-time.
Efficient Query Decomposition: Splits incoming queries into sub-queries (filtering, aggregation, global computation) and distributes them optimally.
Improved Performance: Demonstrated 20% faster query response times and 15% reduced resource consumption compared to static allocation methods.
Scalable & Flexible: Supports heterogeneous IoT devices and ensures load balancing across layers.

System Architecture:

Device Layer: Performs minimal operations like filtering at sensor nodes.
Edge Layer: Handles partial aggregations and context-aware computations closer to data sources.
Cloud Layer: Performs complex computations, global aggregations, and long-term storage.

Results:

Average Query Response Time: 2.18 seconds
Device Layer handled majority of lightweight queries
Edge Layer optimized intermediate processing
AI-based routing ensured effective load balancing and lower energy usage

Applications:
This framework is suitable for real-time IoT domains such as:
Smart Cities (traffic monitoring, energy grids)
Healthcare (remote patient monitoring)
Industrial IoT (predictive maintenance, automation)
Agriculture (sensor-based precision farming)
